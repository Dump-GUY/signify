PESigCheck documentation
========================
PESigCheck is a Python module to compute and validate hashes on different file
types, mostly aimed at computing PE Authenticode-signed binaries.

This module is a forked from Google's :mod:`verify_sigs`` module, updated to fit
modern Python standards and be compatible with Python 3. It is **not** a drop-in
replacement, as significant changes have occurred.

This module is not made for compatibility with Python 2.x
